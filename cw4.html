        Dear Parents,

We are pleased to inform you that our school will reopen on JUN 2nd for the new academic session. We are excited to welcome our students back to campus after the break and look forward to a productive and joyful learning experience ahead.

Parents are kindly requested to ensure that their children return to school in proper uniform, with all necessary books, stationery, and materials required for the classes. Please make sure the school bag is well-prepared according to the timetable shared by the class teachers.

All safety and hygiene measures will continue to be followed on the school premises. We request parents to remind their children about maintaining cleanliness, punctuality, and good discipline during school hours.

Regular attendance from the first day is very important for a smooth start to the academic year. Parents are advised to encourage their children to be regular and punctual to school and to complete all assigned work on time.

We thank you for your continued support and cooperation. Together, let us make this school year successful, enriching, and full of learning opportunities for our students.

With regards,
[ABC School/ Ashwathy]
